XiVO CLI
========

XiVO CLI offers shortcuts for common XiVO CLI commands. For example, instead of typing:
```
less /var/log/xivo-ctid.log
```

you could type:

```
xivo l cti  # short for xivo-log cti
```

The XiVO CLI is inspired by the `ip` command interface, in particular the command abbreviation logic.

Currently supported commands:

* xivo-log
